## Problem Description <a name = "description"></a>

One of the tools to help us manage the COVID-19 pandemic is contact tracing. When one person is
diagnosed with COVID-19, the ability to notify other individuals who have been in contact with the person who is COVID-positive allows us to limit the spread of the disease faster.

At the same time, the ability to use contact information to detect the frequency of large gatherings also helps us understand the community’s compliance with physical distancing advisories.

For this project, we will replicate scaled-down functionality of the Canadian federal government’s
application for contact tracing.
